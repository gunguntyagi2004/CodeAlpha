            <h1>About <span>Me</span> </h1>
            <h4>FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPER !</h4>
            <p>a full-stack web developer with hands-on experience across both front-end and back-end development. I’ve worked on numerous real-life projects, which has taught me the value of creating user-friendly, efficient, and scalable web solutions. On the front end, I’m skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks like React, enabling me to build visually appealing and responsive interfaces. For the back end, 
                I work with technologies like Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB and MySQL to ensure smooth, secure, and reliable performance.
        Each project has strengthened my problem-solving abilities and adaptability.
         I’m also committed to staying current with industry trends to keep my work innovative and aligned with best practices. Beyond technical skills, I prioritize creating intuitive user experiences, as I believe that a great website should not only function well but also engage and satisfy its users. I’m eager to bring my technical expertise, creativity, and dedication to your team and make a meaningful contribution to impactful projects here.</p>
